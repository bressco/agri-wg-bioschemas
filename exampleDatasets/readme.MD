# Example datasets
The file in this folder contain a list of example datasets and infrastructures which can be used to search for additional data
Each dataset has a short set of metadata including the entities/types it conains. The 'status' of a dataset can be:
- 'new': The dataset was only collected but not yet analysed
- 'in progress': A working group member has started analysing the dataset
- 'done': Analysis of the metadata of this dataset is finished

For thorough analysis of a dataset a new folder for each dataset can be created. It should be named after the 'id' of the dataset (e.g. '001'). Notes on the dataset should include a list of available metadata properties (structured in the metadata itself or unstructured as part of the data itself, unstructured metadata or a related publication.)
Once analysis of a dataset has started, a link to the respective folder should be added as the 'analysisLink' attribute in the 'exampleDatasets.csv' file.
