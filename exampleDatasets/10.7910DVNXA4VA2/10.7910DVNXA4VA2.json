    "identifier": "https://doi.org/10.18174/odjar.v6i0.16397",
    "description": "The dataset contains 6 growing seasons of a local winter wheat cultivar ‘Wakanui’ at two farms located in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand. The data of the experiment was used in the AgMIP-Wheat Phase 4 project to evaluate the performance of an ensemble of 29 crop models to predict the effect of changing sowing dates and rates on yield and yield components, in a high-yielding environment. The treatments were managed for non-stress conditions. Data include local daily weather, soil characteristics and initial soil N conditions, crop measurements (anthesis and maturity dates, total above-ground biomass, final grain yield, and yield components), and cultivar information. Simulations include both daily in-season and end-of-season results from 29 wheat crop models. (2021-11-03) ",
