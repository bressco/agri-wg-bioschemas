    "description": "The data deposited here refer to the publication of research results in connection with the MonViA project (monitoring of biological diversity in agricultural landscapes). On three neighboring fields of a farm near Hildesheim, the abundance and diversity of the soil microbiological community was recorded in a 14-day time grid over a period of 2 years. On the fields, which differed in soil texture (loam and clay) and tillage (conservation and conventional), agricultural measures were carried out according to conventional practice. In order to investigate influencing factors, meteorological data and physicochemical soil properties were recorded in parallel (pH value, organic carbon and total nitrogen content). For microbiological characterization, soil DNA was examined using PCR methods. The abundance was determined with quantitative PCR (qPCR), the diversity with the sequencing of PCR products using IlluminaMiSeq technology.",
