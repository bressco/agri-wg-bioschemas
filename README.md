# Introduction
The repository is used by the Agri Bioschemas working group for drafting and discussing modelling ideas for extending the [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) vocabulary with new types, properties and profiles.

# Structure
Developments are distinguished between Types and Profiles, each with their respective folders and subfolders.

 - exampleDatasets.md: A markdown file with a collection of datasets where information on a type can be found (mostly in unstructured ways)
 - abcType.md: A markdown file for a type including its place in the Schema.org hierarchy, a description and a list of properties
 
Some examples that include multiple types (e.g. current work on describing data with LabProcess/LabProtocol) are collected  in the "multiTypeExamples" folder
