# Introduction
The repository is used by the Agri Bioschemas working group for drafting and discussing modelling ideas for extending the [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) vocabulary with new types, properties and profiles.

# Structure
Developments are distinguished between Types, each with their respective folders and subfolders. Some examples that include multiple types (e.g. current work on describing data with LabProcess/LabProtocol) are collected  in the "multiTypeExamples" folder
Each type folder containts a markdown file fincluding its place in the Schema.org hierarchy, a description and a list of properties
 
To identify relevant properties for the types we analyse example datasets from a broad spectrum of Research Data Infrastructures (RDIs). A list of those RDIs and links to the example datasets are collected in the "exampleDatasets" folder.
